# Instructions

Secluso is fully open source and hence can be used by anyone interested in it.
Below are the instructions.
Note that some of the steps are shared between the standalone camera setup and the IP camera setup.
The other steps however are customized for each setup.

## Requirements

You will need the following:

- A smartphone (see [here](README.md) for the list of smartphones tested with Secluso).
- A server. The server needs to be accessible by the hub and the mobile app on the smartphone. Given that the smartphone could be connected to various networks, the server should have a public IP address. We refer to this address as the server IP address going forward.
- A Google account to set up the FCM project. (Create a new account. Don't use your personal account.)

In the case of a standalone camera, you also need:

- A Raspberry Pi board and a camera connected to it. Note that we currently compile the camera hub on the Raspberry Pi itself. While you can run the hub on a weak Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero 2W), we suggest using a more powerful Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4) for building the hub.

In the case of an IP camera, you also need:

- An IP camera (see [here](README.md) for the list of IP cameras tested with Secluso).
- A local machine (e.g., a laptop or desktop). The local machine will be connected to the IP camera and to the Internet.

Fetch the Secluso source code in the Raspberry Pi where you'll build the hub (for the standalone camera), in the local machine (for the IP camera), and in the server:

```
git clone https://github.com/secluso/secluso.git
```

## Step 1: Generating Secluso credentials

The server is fully untrusted and cannot decrypt videos.
Yet, we have a simple authentication protocol between the hub/app and the server in order to prevent unauthorized access to the server (since servers cost money and you may not want others to use your server.)

To generate credentials, do the following (preferrably in the local machine):

```
cd secluso/config_tool
cargo run -- --generate-user-credentials --server-addr <SERVER_URL> --dir .
```

This generates two files: user_credentials and user_credentials_qrcode.png.
We will use the former for the server and the latter for the app.
Keep these files in mind and we will come back to using them in the following steps.

## Step 2: Generating FCM credentials

Secluso uses FCM to send notifications to the android/ios app.
We need to set up an FCM project and then generate two credential files, one for the server to be able to send notifications via FCM and one for the app to be able to receive them.

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/

(Sign in to the Google account you created if you have not.)

Click on "Create a project."

Enter the project name, e.g.: Secluso

Disable Google Analytics (unless you want it).

The project is now created and you will be redirected to its dashboard.

Click on "Add app" and then on the Android or iOS icon.

Now you need to register our app. For the package name, add: com.secluso.mobile

Then click on Register App. 

You don't need to continue with the rest of the steps (as we have already done those for the app).

Now go back to the Firebase project dashboard. Click on the Settings icon next to the project overview on the top left. Then click "Project settings".

On the top, click on the "Service accounts" tab, then on Generate new private key, and (read the warning) then Generate key.

This will create a json file for you. As the warning said, it includes a private key. Therefore, do not share it publicly. Rename this file to: service_account_key.json

Hold on to the file for now. We'll use it in the next step.

## Step 3: Running the server

The server needs to be able to send notification requests to FCM. Therefore, copy the service_account_key.json file generated in the last step in the Secluso server directory.

```
mv /path-to-json-file/service_account_key.json /path-to-secluso/server/
```

Also, copy the user_credentials file we generated in step 1 to the user_credentials directory in the server.

```
mv /path-to-user-credentials/user_credentials /path-to-secluso/server/user_credentials/
```

To run the server, you need to execute this command:

```
cd /path-to-secluso/server/
cargo run --release
```

The server binds to 127.0.0.1 by default.
If you must use HTTP and need the server reachable on the network, run:

```
cargo run --release --network-type=http
```

However, the server program might crash.
Or your server machine (e.g., a VM) might reboot.
Therefore, we suggest using a systemd service to ensure that the server program is restarted after every crash and after every reboot.
You can find instructions to do this online, e.g., ([here](https://www.shubhamdipt.com/blog/how-to-create-a-systemd-service-in-linux/)).

Here is an example of what the service file could look like.
If you need HTTP, add --network-type=http to ExecStart.

```
[Unit]
Description=secluso_server

[Service]
User=your-username
WorkingDirectory=/absolute-path-to-secluso-source/server/
ExecStart=/absolute-path-to-cargo-executable/cargo run --release --network-type=https
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Put these inside the file "/etc/systemd/system/secluso.service".
Then do the following

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start secluso.service
```

Then, check to make sure it's correctly started:

```
sudo systemctl status secluso.service
```

Finally, enable it so that it runs on every reboot:

```
sudo systemctl enable secluso.service
```

Note: running our server launches an HTTP server on the local IP address.
We recommend, however, to use HTTPS to connect to the server.
To do this, you can use an nginx reverse proxy in the server machine.
Using HTTPS protects (by encryption) the server credentials, which would otherwise be sent in plaintext with HTTP.
If however you cannot use HTTPS and have to use HTTP, make sure to change this line in the server (main.rs):

```
address: "127.0.0.1".parse().unwrap(),
```

to

```
address: "0.0.0.0".parse().unwrap(),
```

## Step 4 (standalone camera only): Install rpicam-apps

We need to install rpicam-apps inside the Raspberry Pi in order to use a camera connected to it.
Do the following within the Raspberry Pi:

```
### install all the packages needed in the process
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install -y libcamera-dev libepoxy-dev libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libpng-dev
sudo apt install -y cmake libboost-program-options-dev libdrm-dev libexif-dev
sudo apt install -y meson ninja-build

### download the rpicam-apps source code
git clone https://github.com/secluso/rpicam-apps.git

### build and install it
cd rpicam-apps
meson setup build -Denable_libav=disabled -Denable_drm=enabled -Denable_egl=disabled -Denable_qt=disabled -Denable_opencv=disabled -Denable_tflite=disabled -Denable_hailo=disabled
meson compile -C build -j 1
meson install -C build
```

## Step 4 (IP camera only): Configuring the IP camera and connecting it to your local machine

Our goal is to connect the camera to your local machine (aka machine) without giving the IP camera Internet access.
You will use this local machine later to run the Secluso camera hub software.
To achieve this, we will use two network interfaces of the machine.
One will be used for Internet access for the machine and the other will be used to create a local network to connect the IP camera to the machine.
For example, assume the machine has Ethernet and WiFi interfaces.
The IP camera should be connected to the machine using Ethernet.
Therefore, you will use WiFi for Internet access for the machine.
This is the setup for which we provide instructions below.

Note: you might wonder if you can connect the camera wirelessly to the local machine? This is technically doable, but it opens up an attack vector. The videos will be transmitted unencrypted from the camera to the local machine. An attacker present in the vicinity of your house can then snif the packets and record the videos. Therefore, we do not recommend this setup and do not provide instructions on how it could be configured.

Back to instructions:

Create a local network on the machine's Ethernet interface:

```
sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.1/24 dev [eth0]
```

(Note that you might need to rerun this command if you reboot your local machine or if you disconnect/reconnect the camera's Ethernet cable.)

Replace [eth0] with your interface name.

To find your Ethernet interface name, you can run:

```
ifconfig
```

Then, connect the IP camera with an Ethernet cable to the machine.
Now, we need to find the IP address assigned to the IP camera. Run:

```
nmap -sP 192.168.1.1/24
```

You'll see 192.168.1.1 (which is the machine) and another one (let's say 192.168.1.108) for the IP camera.
Record the IP camera's IP address. You will use it in the next steps and also later for configuring the Secluso camera hub software.

Now open a browser in the local machine and put the IP camera's address there.
You'll see the camera's web interface.
Enter the default username and password (admin and admin on my camera).
It will then ask you to change the password.
Choose a strong password.

In the camera's web interface, do the following (note that these instructions are for the aforementioned Amcrest camera):

1) **Go Setup -> Camera -> Video -> Main Stream**. Set the Encode Mode to H.264, Smart Codec to Off, resolution to 1280x720(720P), framerate to 10, Bit Rate Type to CBR, and Bit Rate to Customized. Then uncheck Watermark Settings, and ensure Sub stream is enabled. We suggest using the following parameters for substream: Encode Mode: MJPEG, Resolution: VGA, frame rate: 10, bit rate: 1024. Make sure to press Save. These suggestions (and the ones below for audio) are simply based on my experience. With these, the videos have adequate quality and Secluso achieves good performance. You might need to change these based on your network connection's bandwidth.

2) **Go to Setup -> Camera -> Audio**. Under Main Stream, set Encode Mode to AAC and sampling frequency to 8000. Disable Sub Stream. Press Save.

3) **Go Setup -> Camera -> Video -> Overlay**. Disable Channel Title, Time, and Logo Overlay to remove clutter from the video, and reduce any effects this might have on built-in motion detection.

You are now done configuring the camera. Make sure to connect the machine to the Internet using WiFi.

## Step 5 (standalone camera only): Configuring and running camera hub

We recommend using one of our **pre-built releases** from the
releases page. Download the appropriate binary for your Raspberry Pi and run it directly on the device.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build it yourself</strong></summary>
Note: You must have an ARM64 machine in order to build it yourself with this system. 

Instead of building the hub directly with `cargo`, we strongly recommend using our
deterministic reproducible build system. This ensures that the binaries you run
are verifiable against source and match our official releases.

See [releases/README.md](releases/README.md) for full details on the build pipeline.

In short:

1. On your development machine (not directly on the Raspberry Pi), cd into the releases folder and run:
```
./build.sh --target raspberry --profile camerahub
```

3. Copy the relevant binary `builds/time/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/secluso-raspberry-camera-hub` onto your device. Time resembles your current system time and will be replaced with a long number (you can ignore this)
4. Run it directly on the device:
```./secluso-raspberry-camera-hub```
</details>

The camera hub is designed so that it can be resumed if it stops either intentionally or due to an error/panic.
Therefore, it is recommended to either use a service to run it (see the instructions for configuring a service for the server) or use a script to run it again when it terminates.
Here's an example service file to have the camera hub be launched at boot time and after every termination:

```
[Unit]
Description=secluso_camera_hub
RequiresMountsFor=/home

[Service]
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/absolute-path-to-secluso-binary/
Environment="RUST_LOG=info"
Environment="LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-}"
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/test -w /absolute-path-to-secluso-binary/
ExecStart=/absolute-path-to-secluso-binary/secluso-raspberry-camera-hub
Restart=always
RestartSec=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Step 5 (IP camera only): Configuring and running camera hub

Copy over the example_cameras.yaml file into cameras.yaml
```
cp example_cameras.yaml cameras.yaml
```

You can add as many cameras as you want by copy and pasting the individual camera blocks
```
  - name: "Front Door"
    ip: "IP address of camera configured in Step 3"
    rtsp_port: 554
    motion_fps: 5
    username: "username here"
    password: "password here"
```

You may choose to omit the username and password, which will instead prompt you upon executing the program below.

The RTSP port is usually 554, but may vary depending on your camera.

Motion FPS is the amount of times per second that we run our motion detection algorithm against the most recent frame.

```
cd /path-to-secluso/camera_hub
cargo run --release --features ip
```

The Secluso hub will now run and ask you for the username and password for each IP camera if not provided originally in the configuration file. 
After providing them, it will create a QR code containing a secret needed for pairing (camera_hub/camera_name_secret_qrcode.png).
Each camera then waits to be paired with the app.

## Step 6: Building and installing the app


Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/secluso/mobile_app.git  
cd mobile_app
```

---

Open the Project in Visual Studio Code:

- Launch Visual Studio Code
- Open the mobile_app/ folder  
- Install any recommended extensions (Flutter, Rust, Dart)

---

Install Flutter Packages:

```
flutter pub get
```

Firebase Setup (Push Notifications):

1. Follow the [official Firebase guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios)
2. When asked which platforms to support, select **iOS** and **Android** only.
3. After setup, move the generated file:

```
lib/firebase_options.dart → lib/notifications/firebase_options.dart
```

---

Compile Rust Code for Android (skip to run section for iOS):

From the project root:

```
cd rust
```

Add Android build targets:

```
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

Build and export to the Android JNI directory:

```
cargo ndk -o ../android/app/src/main/jniLibs build
```

This will generate .so files for each architecture and place them in the appropriate folder.

---

Run on a Physical Android/iOS Device

1. Plug in your Android/iOS device via USB
2. Enable Developer Mode and USB Debugging
3. Ensure the device is recognized in Visual Studio Code (bottom-right status bar)
4. From the project root, run:

```
flutter run
```

This will build and launch the app on your connected device.


## Step 7: Pairing the app with the hub

When you first run the app, it will ask you for the credentials needed to access the server in the form of a QR code.
Scan user_credentials_qrcode.png file that you generated in Step 1.
Note that the app will ask you for permission to access the camera in order to scan the QR code.
It is enough to give one-time access to the app.
It does not need the camera other than for scanning QR codes (also needed when pairing with the camera).

Next, the app will ask you for notifications permissions.
Grant the permissions if you want to receive motion notifications.

Next, you will go to the main app page.
To pair with the camera, press the + button on the bottom right of the screen.
A new activity will be launched asking you the type of the camera you want to pair with.

For the standalone camera, select the first option and follow the instructions.
These steps include scanning the secret QR code, entering a name for the camera, and entering the SSID and password for the WiFi network that you want the camera to connect to.
The name can be anything you'd like to use to refer to the camera (anything without a space).
For the secret QR code, you need to generate it and provide a copy for the camera hub to in the Raspberry Pi to use.
More specifically, you can use the config tool:

```
cd secluso/config_tool
cargo run -- --generate-camera-secret --dir .
```

This will generate two files: camera_secret and camera_secret_qrcode.png. The former is for the camera hub in the Raspberry Pi. The latter is to be scanned by the app. Note that the secret needs to be kept confidential.


For the IP camera, select the second option.
You will then need to enter a name for the camera, the IP address of the hub, and the camera secret QR code.
The QR code is the one that the camera hub generated (camera_hub/camera_name_secret_qrcode.png).
The IP address is the address of the hub (not the IP camera!).
The smartphone running the app and the machine running the hub need to be connected to the same network for the pairing process.
Therefore, make sure they are both connected to the same router.
To find the IP address of the hub, you can again use the ifconfig command.

Once you've provided all, click on ADD CAMERA.
The camera hub and the app should be paired now.
The camera hub will also print:

```
[Camera Name] Pairing successful.
[Camera Name] Running...
```

At this point, the system is operational.
Whenever the camera detects an event, the camera hub will record a video and send it to the app.
Also, in the app, you can livestream the camera.
